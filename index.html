     <p></p> <h2>Cultivating skills both inside and outside the classroom</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Capstones provide students with the opportunity to gain real-world experience by preparing a deliverable to a client in the world of government, private enterprise, or research. Most students at the Bush School find capstones to be a challenging and rewarding experience. A majority of students attend the Bush School because it emphasizes this practitioner perspective over a traditional Master’s Thesis.</p>

      <h2><strong>Capstone: Homeland Security</strong></h2>
    </div>
    <p><p>One of our 2024 MPSA capstone projects involves collaboration with the Brooks County Sheriff's Office. Led by Associate Professor Dan DeBree, who has over 30 years of experience in military and homeland security, the project is being undertaken by a team of 13 MPSA students.</p>
<p>The Brooks County Sheriff’s search and recovery team rescues migrants in distress and attempts recovery and identification of deceased migrants. Over the course of the school year, Professor DeBree’s students will observe and gather data in the field, meet with Customs and Border Protection officials and local nonprofits, and test drone technologies that could assist in locating migrants. They aim to propose viable solutions to the humanitarian crisis affecting Brooks County and much of South Texas. </p>

      <h3><strong>Homeland Security (cont.)</strong></h3>
    </div>
  <p>The inspiration behind this project was Emma Newman, a Texas A&amp;M doctoral anthropology student researching the crisis in Brooks County. Seeking a deeper understanding, she enrolled in Professor DeBree's class on border security. Intrigued by her research, Professor DeBree decided to visit and observe the crisis firsthand. This led to the capstone’s creation, with Newman as a co-primary investigator. <strong>This capstone is a great example of how the Bush School takes on relevant challenges and teaches students how to tackle complex situations.</strong> For full capstone story <strong><a href="https://bush.tamu.edu/capstone-homeland-security/?utm_source=Newsweek&utm_medium=NW&utm_campaign=NW24">click here</a></strong>.</p><p><img src="images/brooks 2.png" width="250" height="157" alt=""/></p>

      <h2><strong>CAPSTONE: Nonprofit</strong></h2>
    </div>
    <p>Another groundbreaking capstone led by Dr. Robbie Robichau, a Bush School alumna herself, focused on anti-human trafficking and the nonprofit sector. The MPSA students developed and analyzed a comprehensive, longitudinal U.S. Human Trafficking Policy Database that included 27 policy indicators over 21 years across all 50 states. They also conducted additional research examining three case study states - Florida, Oklahoma, and North Carolina - to identify current progress and future improvements. To understand the implementation of policies detailed in the Database, they also conducted in-depth interviews with stakeholders from government, nonprofits, law enforcement, and other sectors in anti-human trafficking. </p>
	<p>Recent MPSA graduate Lizette Beltran credits her experience and research with the capstone in securing her position with the federal government’s Department of Labor in Austin, Texas. She believes her new employers were impressed with the relevant skills and knowledge she demonstrated in this policy field.
